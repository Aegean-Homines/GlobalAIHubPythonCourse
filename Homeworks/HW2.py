#Explain your work
"""
Program flow:
1. There's the main function all the way down below. That's the starting point
2. The main function implementation is right above it. I divided each operation into their own functions
so should be easy to check out what each function does
    a. Register/Update account
    b. Delete account
    c. List accounts
    NOTE: 
    To list all accounts, you need the admin access information
    username: admin
    password :admin
3. Each function should also have a javadoc style description above it (might not be, lets see if I'll have time)
4. Don't let the file size scary you, it's mostly print statements.
If I have time in the end, I'll move them into helper functions but for now 
they're in the code itself (which is ugly but I don't get to be this sloppy in professional life let me have my fun while learning something new)
 
Notes:
1. I wanted to add some returning back functionality but as the menu tree got deeper
the functionality got more and more complex so I had to compromise at some point by making it
go all the way back rather than looping through every submenu with return options
2. The main loop is simple:
    a. The app gets the data from the local file (Was gonna go with DB, if I have some time I will. If not, it's a json file')
    b. All the operations are done on the memory. It doesn't affect the file 
    (cause it's already too complex and I don't wanna check more test case scenarios')
    c. On exit (both normally and in the case of ctrl+c exit) I update the json file with the information
3. All options are in the menu. Each menu item is it's own function.
4. Util import holds all the large print statement bodies and some helper functions
I should probably move ALL string-related stuff there but it didn't help a lot with the file size when I thought about it
so I just have some one or two liner print statements in between the logic
   
Now the underlying stuff:
1. I'm holding the data in a dictionary in "username":"password" format
2. All account operations (insertion, deletion, update and list) happens there
3. (Currently) on exit, I'm saving the data to a json file to keep it between sessions
I chose json cause it's basically THE file format for dictionary. Also, and I didn't know that,
but Python built-in json library returns a dictionary on parsing which is quite cool

MAIN FLOW:
    Roleplay as an evil corp, print some evil corp stuff
    
    If a file exists - get data from the file
    Cache it in a dictionary
    if not open up a new one
    
    Show a menu:
        1-) Register account
        2-) Delete account
        3-) List account
    
    Register:
        1-) Get username - pass
        2-) Store it in the dictionary
    
    Delete:
        1-) Find account in Dict
        2-) Delete it from the Dict
    
    List:
        1-) Iterate over Dict
        2-) Print everything
    
    On exit:
        1-) Store dictionary in a file
        2-) Exit the app
    
    
EXTRAS:
    1-) Change file into db (python apparently has sqlite built in)
    2-) Username - password syntax check (regex or str.issomething() stuff)
