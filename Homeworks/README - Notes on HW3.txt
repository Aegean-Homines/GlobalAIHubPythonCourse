If you're looking into HW3 after HW2, don't worry this is way more tame than HW2 (again, I went a bit overboard with the second one)

The general notes on this one would be:
1-) Information is posted on top of the file. This'll be pretty the summary of that.
2-) I'm using a student class and discuss that decision on the information on top
3-) there's a constant value in the code (USE_FILE). I created that to test the code, it's basically a json file containing student grading information
I set that to False by default (meaning by default, you'll have to enter student info 5 times) but if you want to change that, either set that to True in the code
or run the python file with "True" keyword (anything else and it'll just default back to False)
4-) The output lists the final ordered student info
